# [WIP] Gravity Pathfinder

## About

This is a puzzle game for Android that takes advantage of the accelerometer to affect game objects. As the phone tilts the point of gravity changes. The player is limited to which objects they can manipulate and can only affect one at a time. The goal is to guide an AI through each level by moving around platforms and obstacles.
